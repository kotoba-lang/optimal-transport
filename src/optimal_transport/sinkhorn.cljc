(ns optimal-transport.sinkhorn
  "Entropic-regularized optimal transport (Sinkhorn's algorithm), in the
  LOG-DOMAIN STABILIZED form (dual potentials `f`/`g` updated via
  log-sum-exp, never a raw `exp(-C/epsilon)` Gibbs kernel matrix) so that
  small `epsilon` -- the regime morph-target correspondences actually need,
  since large `epsilon` blurs the transport plan into a diffuse near-uniform
  coupling instead of a sharp near-permutation match -- doesn't overflow/
  underflow in double-precision float arithmetic. Naive multiplicative
  Sinkhorn (`sinkhorn-naive`, also provided here) computes `K = exp(-C/eps)`
  directly and repeatedly rescales `K` by `mu`/`nu`-derived row/column
  factors `u`/`v` -- mathematically identical at the fixed point, but `K`'s
  entries underflow to exact `0.0` once `C/epsilon` gets large, silently
  corrupting the row/column scaling. The two are cross-checked against each
  other in `sinkhorn_test.cljc` at a moderate `epsilon` where naive Sinkhorn
  is still numerically safe.

  Inspired by the optimal-transport / Monge-Kantorovich regularity line of
  work (Figalli et al.'s Monge-Ampere regularity theory studies the SMOOTH,
  PDE-constrained limit of optimal transport; entropic OT is the discrete,
  computationally tractable relaxation actually used here) -- this
  namespace is NOT a Monge-Ampere PDE solver and makes no regularity-theory
  claims. It is a practical, iterative numerical method: Cuturi's 2013
  \"Sinkhorn Distances\" plus the log-domain stabilization standard in
  modern OT solvers (see e.g. Peyre & Cuturi, \"Computational Optimal
  Transport\", Remark 4.10 / Section 4.4, for the same f/g update this
  namespace implements).

  Complexity: O(n*m) per iteration (`n` source points, `m` target points --
  every f/g dual-potential update visits every cost-matrix entry once),
  O(n*m*iterations) total, O(n*m) memory for the cost matrix and returned
  plan. This is intended for OFFLINE / AUTHOR-TIME morph-target
  PRECOMPUTATION (run once per mesh pair, result baked into a static delta
  array), NOT per-frame runtime use -- `kami.webgpu.mesh`'s `draw!` consumes
  the precomputed `:morph-target-deltas` via a scalar `morph-weights` blend
  at draw time (`orgs/kotoba-lang/webgpu/src/kami/webgpu/mesh.cljs`), it
  never re-solves a transport problem per frame.

  First-class runtime is ClojureScript (browser/Node) per this org's
  runtime-priority policy (`kotoba wasm` > `clojurewasm` > ClojureScript >
  `nbb`, JVM/`bb` demoted to compat-only, com-junkawasaki/root CLAUDE.md
  2026-07-10) -- the `#?(:clj ... :cljs ...)` reader conditionals below
  select `Math/exp`/`Math/log`/`Math/abs` on the JVM and
  `js/Math.exp`/`js/Math.log`/`js/Math.abs` in ClojureScript, the same
  convention as `character.math`
  (`orgs/kotoba-lang/character/src/character/math.cljc`). Tests run via
  `clojure -M:test` for CI convenience -- every sibling `.cljc` repo in this
  org does the same (pragmatic JVM test harness, not a runtime-priority
  statement).")

  "Entropic-regularized optimal transport via log-domain stabilized
  Sinkhorn iteration. Returns the `n x m` transport plan (a vector of `n`
  row-vectors of length `m`, each entry `>= 0.0`) as plain nested vectors --
  a seqable-of-seqables the caller can `nth`/`get-in` into directly.
  Convergence diagnostics (`:sinkhorn/converged?` `:sinkhorn/iterations`
  `:sinkhorn/marginal-violation`) are attached as metadata on the returned
  plan (see the `converged?`/`iterations`/`marginal-violation` accessors,
  above) -- the return value is still just a plan, not a wrapper map.

  Contract: `cost-matrix` is `n x m` (`n` source points `i`, `m` target
  points `j` -- rows/columns must be rectangular, every row the same
  length). `mu` (length `n`) and `nu` (length `m`) are non-negative mass
  vectors; both are independently rescaled to sum to `1.0` before solving,
  so the classical OT requirement 'total source mass = total target mass'
  is automatically satisfied regardless of the caller's raw scale -- if
  exact literal (non-rescaled) mass conservation matters for your use case,
  ensure `mu`/`nu` already both sum to `1.0` before calling.

  Options (`{:keys [epsilon max-iters tol]}`):
  - `epsilon` (default `0.05`) -- entropic regularization strength. Smaller
    -> sharper, closer to an exact (Monge) point-to-point assignment;
    larger -> more diffuse/blurred coupling. Morph-target correspondences
    want small `epsilon` (sharp matches), which is exactly the regime naive
    Sinkhorn is numerically unsafe in and this log-domain form is not.
    CONVERGENCE TRADEOFF: smaller `epsilon` needs proportionally more
    iterations for the same marginal tolerance (Sinkhorn's contraction rate
    depends on `epsilon` relative to the cost matrix's spread -- a
    well-separated point cloud converges fast even at small `epsilon`; a
    cost matrix with many near-tied entries relative to `epsilon` converges
    slowly and may need a larger `max-iters`). `converged?`/`iterations` on
    the returned plan tell you whether `max-iters` was actually enough.
  - `max-iters` (default `200`) -- hard iteration cap.
  - `tol` (default `1e-6`) -- convergence check is on MARGINAL VIOLATION
    (`max_i |row-sum(plan)_i - mu_i|`), not iteration count alone: the loop
    stops as soon as the transport plan's row marginals match `mu` within
    `tol`, or `max-iters` is hit, whichever comes first.

  Complexity: O(n*m) per iteration, O(n*m) memory. Intended for
  OFFLINE/PRECOMPUTED use (author-time morph-target generation), not
